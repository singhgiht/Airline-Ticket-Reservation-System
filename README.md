# Airline-Ticket-Reservation-System
This is an Airline Ticket Reservation System Project that was developed using PHP/MySQLi. This ticket reservation system of an airline company serves as the online platform for the Passengers/Customers for booking or reserve their tickets. With the help of this system, the passengers can reserve their flights easily and faster wherever they are. This will help also the Airlines Company to ease the manual system flow and makes their work/process more effective and efficient. The system has 2 types of users which are the Admin and the Customer. The Admin user is in charge of managing the data of the system such as the list of jets, prices, and flight schedules. For the customer, they can simply register to create an account to the system and search if there's an available/scheduled flight for their desired destination and date. After they select their desired flight the system will provide a form to register the details of the passengers and proceeds to payment afterward. The customer can also print/re-print their tickets in the system.

This project was developed using PHP/MySQLi, MySQL Database, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The system source code is free to download. This is only built for educational for purposes and not for commercial use.
